		<center><h1 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Performance
Measurement Systems</h1></center>
		
		<center><h2>Introduction</h2></center><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" />
		<p>Up to now, this book has shown readers the important components in
formulating a successful strategy and good decision-making processes.</p>
		<p>Now imagine the challenge of implementing a strategy formulated in a company
such as Microsoft, with subsidiaries in many countries and a legion of collaborators! How can one ensure that the strategy not be lost in the implementation?</p>
		<p>This chapter intends to touch on issues related to the strategic alignment of the
organization to effectively implement the outlined strategy, as well as the
elements, which are important to developing performance measurement systems to monitor and measure the results obtained from the strategy in process.</p>
		<center><h2>Building a Rapid Strategic Process</h2></center><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" />
		<p>Have you asked yourself what is the reigning strategy in the organization where
you work? Do you know that your daily activities contribute (or not) to the
organization reaching it strategic objectives?
</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, often the response to these questions is “no”. This happens
because the process of formulating and implementing strategy is very slow and
it is carried out in isolation by the highest levels of administration, so that it is
lost in the day-to-day operations of the organization.</p>
		<p>Mintzberg (1994) stresses that planning cannot be dissociated from action, and
requires the involvement of the entire organization, while also warning of three
fallacies of strategic planning: prediction is possible; detachment, i.e., the
separation of the strategist from the objects of strategy; and the strategic
planning process can be formalized.</p>
		<p>These three fallacies help to dissociate strategic planning from strategic
thinking. They lead to bureaucratic decision-making processes. What should
be a support tool to facilitate human thinking could become a straight jacket,
an arbitrary formalization.
</p>
		<p>Mintzberg and Waters (1985) give more emphasis to an organization’s actions
than its systematized plans and goals. These plans are created by top management or consultants and are called intentional strategies</p>
		<p>However, there is another pattern of strategic action that occurs in the absence
of intentions called emergent strategies. Theses strategies result from threats
and opportunities, which are in the course of everyday work life and demand
responses from those managers who have the task of executing the organization’s
strategy.
</p>
		<p>Any process that does not take into account intentional as well as emerging
strategies will dissociate strategy from action, resulting in a lack of alignment.
</p>
		
		<h2>Formulating and Implementing Strategy in Turbulent
Environments</h2><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" />
		<p>Various authors emphasize the need for change in the process of formulating
and implementing strategy in the face of ever more rapid changes in the
competitive environment (Christensen, 1997; Eisenhardt & Browns, 2000;
Eisenhardt & Sull, 2001).</p>
		<p>Eisenhardt and Browns (2000) researched top management teams at a dozen
companies in the Silicon Valley, trying to identify the strategic decision-making
process, especially in turbulent markets. At a second stage of research, another
12 companies were studied, six leaders and six followers from different
European, Asian, and North American origins.
</p>
		<p>In both research phases, the differences between the strategic decision-making
processes used by the more efficient and less efficient companies were clear.
Successful strategies are the result of decision-making processes in which
executives develop collective intuition, stimulate constructive conflict, maintain
the pace of decisions and avoid petty politicking, making rapid, high quality,
and widely supported decisions. The trade-offs between speed and quality of
the decisions were not verified however.</p>
		<p>Eisenhardt and Browns (2000) identified four basic subprocesses for creating
strategy:
</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Creation of a collective understanding (intuition), which strengthens the
ability of top management to identify opportunities and threats earlier and
more accurately.</li>
			<li>Stimulation of rapid conflicts to improve the quality of strategic thinking
without losing time.
</li>
			<li>Maintenance of a disciplined pace in the decision-making process, which
leads to concluding it on time.</li>
			<li>Discouragement of corporate petty politicking, since it creates nonproductive conflicts and wastes time.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>In an earlier work, Eisenhardt and Sull (2001) identified a new way of leading
the strategic process that they called<i> simple rules</i>. Of course it is important to
write the correct rules, avoiding creating heavy guideline manuals in order to
keep from paralyzing the organization. In the companies studied, the number of
rules varied from two to seven.</p>
		<p>These rules should be followed religiously, as if they were the organization’s
<i>Ten Commandments</i>, and any temptation to change them frequently should be
avoided.
</p>
		<p>The strategic process of simple rules, appropriate for turbulent markets, has
broad categories of rules as the following:<i> how-to, frontier, priority, time,
and exit.</i>
</p>
		
		<center><h2>Strategic Performance
Measurement and Monitoring</h2><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" /></center>
		
		<p>According to Carvalho and Laurindo (2003), the relevance of alignment
between business strategy and its operational performance has been increasingly studied. Different approaches can be found in the academic and
practitioner’s bibliography, emphasizing the importance of linking effectiveness
to goals, objectives and requirements of organizations, in order to manage
operational performance continuously (Tonchia, 2000; Kaplan & Norton,
1992, 1993, 1996, 2000; Rockart, 1979; Broadbent & Weill, 1997).</p>
		<p>An effective performance measurement system (PMS) has the following
constituent parts: “(1) individual measures that quantify the efficiency and
effectiveness of actions; (2) a set of measures that combine to assess the
performance of an organization as a whole; and (3) a supporting infrastructure
that enables data to be acquired, collated, sorted, analyzed, interpreted and
disseminated” (Kennery & Neely, 2000). With regard to this second part of
PMS, currently popular methods, such as the Balanced Scorecard (BSC)
(Kaplan & Norton, 1992), the Performance Pyramid (Kerseens-van Drongelen,
2000) and the Performance Prism (Kennerly & Neely, 2000), can be found.
Among them, BSC became the most widely used method.
</p>
		<p>The BSC was developed by Kaplan and Norton (1992) with the aim of learning
about all the complexity existing in organizational performance evaluation
(Epstein & Manzoni, 1997). Traditional methods of measurement always
prioritize a financial-accounting measure that does not measure intangible
assets, which are fundamental in the competitive environment. Intangible assets
such as client relations, the ability and knowledge of the work force, information
technology, and a corporate culture that encourages innovation and continuous
improvement, despite having become a source of competitive advantage, were
not contemplated by traditional tools since intangible assets depend on the
organization’s context and its strategy.</p>
		<p>The BSC sums up, therefore, in a single document — the strategic map — the
organization’s performance from four perspectives, involving, besides the
traditional financial perspective, the client perspective, the learning and
growth perspective, and the perspective of internal processes, forming a
balanced set of performance indicators for a company.</p>
		<p>This balanced set of indicators, the balanced scorecard, results in a clear map
of the vision and strategies of an organization, converting them into action. The BSC provides feedback from internal as well as external processes with the aim
of continuously seeking better strategic performance and better results (Kaplan
& Norton, 1992). With the BSC, the perspectives of all the stakeholders are
contemplated, providing the strategic alignment of the organization and its
business units, promoting a vision of the business which is both synthetic and
far-reaching.
</p>
		<p>Kaplan and Norton (1992) make an analogy of the BSC to the map used by
a general to lead troops in foreign territory. This map is necessary to have
detailed local knowledge and to communicate war strategy to the officers and
the rest of the troops.
</p>
		<p>The BSC helps to overcome the lack of ability that traditional strategic
management systems have in connecting long-term strategy with short-term
activities (Kaplan & Norton, 1996).</p>
		<p>Figure 6.1 illustrates the BSC model. Observe that each perspective should
have its own cast of performance indicators, which should reflect the singular
needs of each organization in the search for its vision.</p>
		<p>The BSC translates vision and strategy into learning, abilities, and systems that
employees need to develop (theirlearning and growth) to innovate and build
the correct and efficient strategic capacities (internal processes) that will
deliver specific value to the market (clients) that can increase value (financial)
to the shareholder (Epstein and Manzoni, 1997). This comprehension of the
way one intends to reach the desired performance level for each of the
perspectives, with the strategy at the center, is one of the main advantages of
this model. It is stressed that the perception of trade-offs among the measures
and the creation of a network of performance indicators constitutes an
important tool to promote and commit the entire organization to the strategy at
all levels (Epstein & Manzoni, 1997).</p>
		<h3 style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Figure 6.1. Four perspectives (adapted from Kaplan & Norton, 1996a)
</i></h3>

			</center>
		<p>Following is a presentation of the four perspectives of the BSC, as well as the
main requirements for installing this model.
</p>
		<h2>Financial Perspective
</h2><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" />
		<p>The strategic map begins with financial strategy to increase value to the
shareholder. As remarked earlier, Kaplan and Norton (1992) did not discard
the traditional financial side, but emphasized the search for balance with the
other perspectives.
</p>
		<p>The objectives and financial measures need to perform a double function: to
define the financial performance expected of the strategy and to serve as the
main goal for the objectives and measures of all the other BSC perspectives.</p>
		<p>The<i> financial perspective</i> defines the long-term goals of the business unit, not
limiting it to profitability objectives. However, within this perspective, companies generally work with three financial themes:<i>revenue growth and mix, cost
reduction/productivity gains, and utilization of assets/strategic investment</i>. The theme ofrevenue growth and mix is concentrated on developing
new sources of revenue and profitability, such as franchises or increasing value
to clients. Franchises provide new sources of revenue deriving from new
markets, new products or new clients, requiring, however, greater changes and
longer execution times. Immediately increasing value to clients, by means of
broadening the relationship with clients and a change in the mix of existing
products and services with offers of greater added value, can generate results
in the midterm. The issue of <i>costs reduction/ productivity gains</i> seeks the
efficient execution of operational activities, reducing direct and indirect costs
of products and services, sharing common resources with other units of the
business and increasing efficiency, with the current client base. The issue of
<i>utilization of assets and strategic investment</i> intends to reduce the levels of
capital investment required to support a given volume and mix in the business
unit.</p>
		<p>Kaplan and Norton (1996) stress however, that there is a range of possible
financial objectives that should be considered, which vary depending on the
stage of the business; there are three stages in which the business unit can be
located — <i>rapid growth, maintenance, and harvesting</i>. The business units
that are at the stage of rapid growth are those in the initial stages of their life
cycle. At this stage, the business needs to make significant investments to
develop and expand its productive capacity, new products and services,systems, infrastructure, distribution networks, and client relations. Business at
the maintenance stage aims to ensure its market share and perhaps increase it,
focusing on investments in bottlenecks and expanded capacity as well as
continuous improvement. Finally, business at the harvesting stage has reached
the phase of maturity in its life cycle, making only the investments necessary to
maintain equipment and capacity, prioritizing short-term investments with short
periods of return with the main objective to maximize the corporate cash flow.
The <i>portfolio</i> models can help in comprehending these stages. It is possible to
suggest some financial objectives that translate the specifics of each of these
stages as presented in Table 6.1.</p>
		<p>Kaplan and Norton (2000) summarize two basic strategies for this perspective:
revenue growth and productivity. The strategy for revenue growth is concentrated on developing new sources of revenue and profitability, by means of
creating franchises and or increasing value to clients. Franchises are sources of
revenue deriving from new markets, new products and new clients, which cause
greater changes and involving longer timeframes for their execution. To
increase value to clients means expanding existing client relations, obtaining
results in the midterm. Finally, the <i>strategy for productivity</i>, seeks to
efficiently carry out operational activities in support of present clients with a
focus on reducing costs and/or increasing efficiency in addition to better utilizing
assets.</p>

		<h2>Client Perspective
</h2><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" />
		<p>The client perspective should provide a clear vision of the market and client
segments and the performance of the business unit in these segments. An
unsatisfactory performance from this perspective is an indicator of future
decline, even if the financial perspective shows favorable results, although often
the financial scenario reveals itself to be favorable. But to translate the
processes into financial success, companies should put satisfying their clients in
first place.</p>
		<p>In this perspective, there are a series of generic measures such as<i> client
satisfaction, client retention, conquering new clients, client profitability,
and market share in the target segments</i> that could be useful.</p>
		<p>Although the value proposition can vary from the industrial to another sector
and even within market segments inside an industry, the measures shown are
key elements to comprehending what value is for the key segment. Kaplan and
Norton (1996) observe, nevertheless, common sets of attributes, which
organize the values proposed in all industries where they applied the BSC,
which were:<i> product/service characteristics, relationship with clients, and
image and reputation</i>.</p>
		<p>Based on the value proposition, the business unit is able to formulate measures
from the client perspective that translate into market strategy in such as way
as to reap financial returns from the financial perspective.
</p>
		<h2>Internal Processes Perspective
</h2><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" />
		<p>The<i> perspective of internal processes </i>allows identification of critical processes in which the business unit should do better. These processes should
enable the business to deliver the value proposal of the target segment and
satisfy shareholders’ expectations.</p>
		<p>Measurements should focus on the internal processes that will have a greater
impact on customer satisfaction and in meeting financial goals, as Figure 6.2
illustrates.</p>
		<p>Managing processes in the BSC context should not be tied to existing
processes; it is frequently necessary to map new ones. Kaplan and Norton
(1992) identify four levels of process of interest for this perspective: building
business by innovating in products and services and by entering new markets
</p>
		
		<h3 style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Figure 6.2. Model of the generic value chain (Kaplan & Norton, 1996b)

		<p>and client segments; deepening the relationship with existing clients; obtaining
operational excellence through management of supply, cost, quality, and cycle
time; utilization of assets and management capacity. Figure 6.2 shows the
internal processes in a generic value chain.
The financial benefits which come from improving processes usually take place
in stages: control and improvement of existing processes (short term), increased revenue by improving relations with clients (midterm), and the process
of innovation (long-term). A complete strategy should have a return from all
three areas.</p>
		<h2>Learning and Growth Perspective
</h2><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" />
		<p>The learning and growth perspective identifies the infrastructure, which the
organization needs to build to create learning and growth in the long-term.
These are required to meet the objectives from other perspectives. Thus</p>

			</center>
		<p>nvesting in this perspective is a critical factor for the survival and development
of the organization in the long-term.
</p>
		<p>According to Kaplan and Norton (2000), all strategic maps should define the
core competencies, technologies, and the organizational culture needed to
support the organization’s strategy.</p>
		<p>There are three basic points to define measures for learning and growth:
personal, systems, and procedures (Kaplan & Norton, 1996). These objectives enable the company to align its human resources, information, and
technology to its strategy.
</p>
		<p>In order to guarantee the alignment among the four perspectives, each
perspective should be integrated in with other perspectives as shown in Figure
6.3.</p>
		<center><h2>Implementing the BSC
</h2><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" /></center>
		<p>Implementing the BSC is a long process, since it does not consist only of
defining perspectives and their extension into objectives, indicators, and goals.
Involvement, knowledge of internal processes, and a good system of information are needed. Imagine a company that does not have its processes mapped
out! It would have to incorporate management by processes, which always is
a complex task.
</p>

Norton, 1996a)</i></h3>

		</center>
		<p>Kaplan and Norton (1996) identify four management processes, which in
combination with the four perspectives, contribute to connecting long-term
strategic objectives to short-term actions. It could be used also the concept of
P-D-C-C cycle (<i>plan, do, check and action</i>) to BSC implementation. Figure
6.4 illustrates the BSC implementation process.</p>
		
		<p>The<i> process of translating the vision</i> helps to build consensus around the
company’s vision and strategy. One should avoid vague statements such as
“best in its class”, expressing this instead along with performance goals and
measurements.</p>
		<p>The<i> process of communication and connection</i> allows the BSC to be
communicated to all levels, thus linking departmental to individual objectives,
creating a cascading process. One should avoid letting individual incentives
prioritize the short-term goals; they should be aligned to the organizational
strategy.</p>
		<p>The<i> business planning process</i> allows for the integration of the financial and
business planes. Since most organizations implement a number of change
programs simultaneously, each with its gurus and consultants and all competing
for the time and resources of the principal executives, the BSC can be a form
of integrating them around long-term strategies.</p>
		<p>The <i>feedback and learning process </i>gives an organization the capacity for
strategic learning. With the BSC, and organization can monitor its short term
results in the four perspectives, permitting modifications to strategies in
progress, thus reflecting organizational learning.</p>
		<p>These four processes reflect an iterative sequence of actions. To arrive at a
stable management system, according to the example presented by Kaplan and
Norton (1996), can require about thirty months, and an organization can need
to go through these four processes two or three times.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Difficulties in Implementing the BSC
</h2><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" />
		<p>Implementing the BSC is not an easy process, some organizations have
invested considerable financial and human effort in this process without
attaining the hoped for results (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 2000; Kaplan, 1999;
Mercer, 1999; Schneiderman 1999).</p>
		<p>Kaplan (1999) identified six critical aspects in the process of implementing the
BSC that can lead to failure:
